## About this book

This book introduces logistics and perhaps even activity steps for the workshops at the 2026 AnVIL Community Conference at the Broad Institute on Sept 1.

There are 2 60 minute windows with 2 workshops per window. The first window will have an AnVIL 101 Workshop and a Developer "Ask me Anything" Session. The second window will have two workshops that are still to be confirmed, but likely covering AI and Imputation topics.
